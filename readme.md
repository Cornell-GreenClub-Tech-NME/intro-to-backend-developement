# Intro To Backend Development

## Setup

Create a virtual environment and install the requirements located in src/requirements.txt. If you don't remember how to do that, please look back at the previous assignment (Intro to Full Stack Development). 

Next, try running the app using "python app.py". You should be able to go to localhost:8000 using a web browser or Postman and see some output there.

## TODO

There is an unfinished Transaction model in db.py as well as 2 unfinished endpoints in app.py. Please complete those following the specifications.
